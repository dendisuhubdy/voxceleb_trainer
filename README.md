```
python ./trainSpeakerNet.py --model ResNetSE34 --encoder SAP --trainfunc amsoftmax --optimizer adam --save_path data/exp1 --batch_size 200 --max_frames 200 --scale 30 --margin 0.3 --train_list /home/joon/train_list.txt --test_list /home/joon/test_list.txt --train_path /home/joon/voxceleb2 --test_path /home/joon/voxceleb1
```

#### Implemented loss functions
```
Softmax (softmax)
AM-Softmax (amsoftmax)
AAM-Softmax (aamsoftmax)
GE2E (ge2e)
Prototypical (proto)
Triplet (triplet)
Contrastive (contrastive)
Angular Prototypical (angleproto)
```

#### Implemented models and encoders
```
ResNetSE34 (SAP)

```

#### Data

The [VoxCeleb](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/) datasets are used for these experiments.

The train list should contain the identity and the file path, one line per utterance, as follows:
```
id00000 id00000/youtube_key/12345.wav
id00012 id00012/21Uxsk56VDQ/00001.wav
```

The test list can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/meta/veri_test.txt).
